[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ed50f56e-4fc2-4c98-8b66-1e5074c6f3d3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/courier-netlify-msteams/deploys)

This is an Microsoft Teams Bot that can be deployed to a [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) Function. It contains commands for adding [Courier](https://courier.com) recipient profiles for [Microsoft Teams channels and users](https://docs.courier.com/docs/microsoft-teams). This was created as a quick way to get started sending Microsoft Teams notifications using Courier.

## Installation Options

First, sign up for a Courier Developer Account, itâ€™s [free to sign up](https://app.courier.com/register/) and includes 10,000 notifications per month. Next, create a Microsoft Teams application using App Studio inside your Team. Then, choose an option below.

This starter focuses on building profiles using commands. Each command requires a recipient id and will update that profile stored in Courier. You can extend this bot to better fit your use case.

### Option one: One-click deploy

Clicking this button will create a new repo for you that looks like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify. You will be prompted for a repo name and to provide the values for the following environment variables to use with Courier and the Microsoft Teams Bot.
